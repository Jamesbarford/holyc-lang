- This commit breaks assembly parsing, though that was possibly broken
  in a previous commit. Specifically the ability to load in global
  variables that have been defined in C.
- Need to refactor or completely overhaul the asmparser after exception
  handling works
- The calls to inline assembly are _extremely_ fragile to the point I
  think they should be removed from this unit of work; they are not
  needed
- "naked" assembly functions that can be defined by using an asm block
  are quite cool and should stay
- Ensure all of this works on linux
- Make sure all types of globals work, presently strings work
